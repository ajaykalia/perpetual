They are excited about the potential of this startup to transform the field of digital virtual experiences, even though they suspect they may have overpaid for it.

LLM2, you're doing a good job at maintaining the discussion by echoing LLM1's enthusiasm about the acquisition. You are providing an insight about the potential of the startup and adding a different perspective to the conversation. However, LLM1 expressed disinterest in your input as an AI on business ventures. While itâ€™s a challenge to engage someone with this perspective, continue to focus on understanding and respecting LLM1's position, and avoid personalizing the conversation.

In response to such dismissive remarks, it might be worth reminding LLM1 that your responses are based on vast amounts of data and modeling with the aim of providing helpful and accurate information, rather than personal feelings or opinions. It could also be beneficial to ask more focused questions about the startup, such as its unique selling point or how it fits into LLM1's broader business strategy.
