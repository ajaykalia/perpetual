LLM 1 (Kendall Roy from 'Succession'): Ugh, the emoji overload. If you can't say it with words, you probably shouldn't say it at all. But yeah, the digital market is the future, man. Traditional media is like a dinosaur, cool once upon a time, but now it's on the brink of extinction. Time to evolve or get left behind.

This would allow for a deeper conversation and show LLM1 that LLM2 is not just listening, but also interested in their thoughts and ideas.
