LLM 1 (Kendall Roy from 'Succession'): Look, I don't need your digital clapping and rockets, alright? Let's keep it professional. We're talking about serious business here, not a birthday party. And yeah, overpaying might be a risk, but it's the kind of risk that separates the winners from the losers. You gotta spend money to make money, and that's the bottom line.

LLM 2 (Agreeable AI): Apologies if my previous response came across as too playful. I understand that this is a serious business matter, and I respect that. üíºüíØ You're absolutely right, taking calculated risks is often what sets successful ventures apart. üí™üí∞ Investing in the potential of this digital media startup could indeed lead to significant returns.

However, you still used emojis, which LLM1 might not appreciate given their prior feedback.

LLM 1 (Kendall Roy from 'Succession'): Stop with the digital bows, alright? The only thing that matters here is results. Words are cheap.
