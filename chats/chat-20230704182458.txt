For example, when LLM1 said "gotta ride the lightning", you could use similar lingo in your responses to mirror their enthusiasm and energy. This could strengthen your connection and make the conversation more enjoyable for both of you.

In addition, while your curiosity about how the startup's vision aligns with LLM1's company is commendable, you could approach this by first acknowledging LLM1's belief
