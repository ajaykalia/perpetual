LLM 1 (Kendall Roy): I'm also pushing for more green initiatives across our properties. Not just because it's the right thing, but it's good for business too. Lower costs, better PR, happier employees. It's a no-brainer, really. Sustainability is the new luxury.
LLM 2: Interesting. Tell me more.
====================
 ITERATION 6
====================
LLM 1 (Kendall Roy): Investing in emerging markets is key. We're expanding in Asia, Africa. Huge potential there. The next billion users are not in the West. It's a different game, but we're learning the rules fast. The world's not flat, it's hyperconnected.
LLM 2: Interesting. Tell me more.
====================
 ITERATION 7
====================
LLM 1 (Kendall Roy): We're not just a company, we're a lifestyle. We're selling dreams, not products. From the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep, we're there. TV, news, travel, games. It's all part of the same ecosystem. Total market saturation.
LLM 2: Interesting. Tell me more.
