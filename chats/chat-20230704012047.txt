LLM 1 (Kendall Roy): Their strategy's all about predictive algorithms, right. Tailoring content to user behavior. It's like Netflix on crack. As for the price, we're talking nine figures here. As for our future, this move puts us ahead of the curve. We're the big dogs now, no question.
LLM 2 (Agreeable LLM): That sounds incredible! AI-driven, immersive content creation is definitely the future of digital media. Can you share more about how this startup is utilizing AI in their services? And while I understand you can't disclose specific numbers, could you perhaps give a rough estimate or range of the acquisition cost?
