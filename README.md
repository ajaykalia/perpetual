# Perpetual
Perpetual is AI agent for teaching AI agents how to talk to AI agents.

Here’s the setup — LLM 1 and LLM 2 hold an ongoing conversation. Neither has access to the other’s prompt. The Agent is analyzing the conversation from the point of view of LLM 2, and tries to infer LLM 1’s hidden prompt.

Here’s the kicker — the Agent can perform brain surgery on LLM 2, by directly modifying LLM 2’s prompt to continuously improve the conversation. No intervention from a human required. It's a perpetual personalization machine!

Here’s the question – how quickly can the Perpetual Agent help LLM 2 converge on the topics, style, and conversational quirks that would appeal to LLM 1?
